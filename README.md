What is this?: This is a 2d platformer written using Unity2018. The game takes place on an unknown planet where the main character "Barry" has crash landed. In order to repair his damaged ship, Barry must collect various part that have been scattered around the area. Unfortunatelly the planet is dotted with caves, and the parts Barry requires have fallen into them. To escape Barry must collect these parts while dodging/killing the deadly lifeforms that inhabit the planet.

How do I run this?: The files in this repository should allow anyone to open them as a unity project. However since Unity tends to not get along with Git from time to time, there is also a precompiled executable for anyone just interested in playing the game.
